Front End Development (HTML & CSS)

This project is created as part of my Front-End Development subject.
It is a fully responsive Recipe Sharing Platform built using only HTML and CSS, focusing on clean structure, layout design, and user interface styling.

The website allows users to browse different recipes through a visually appealing card layout, organized sections, and a consistent color theme. Even without JavaScript, the project demonstrates strong front-end fundamentals through effective use of CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, and transitions.
